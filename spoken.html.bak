This program is for people who have little knowledge of English and hesitant to speak English. We aim to develop proficiency in the English Language. <br>We work upon their grammar, help them build their word power, and groom their personality so that they have not only a rich knowledge but also a confident personality for effective communication.<br>
<br>
The course has 4 modules: Basic Grammar + Vocabulary + Spoken English + Personality Development. <br>These four modules work upon different aspects and lay a solid foundation of language.
<br>
The basic methodology of the course is to engage you in various activities that help you feel like real-life situations.<br> The courseware has been developed keeping the practical aspect of the learning.
